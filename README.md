# Weather-App

My first API request

If geolocation is given by the user, a script runs which is an API request
Used back quotes to pass geolocation as variables into API string
Fetched all the data in JSON format, then required data sorted into variables
However the provider offers the option to chose what measurement we want to receive, I left it default
so the data provides temperature in farenheit. With a formula, celsius provided as well with an onClick event.

Representative pictures are stored on different URLs.
Weather icon code fetched and passed in a string that using the url of an icon within back quotes again.
The icon codes are passed as a variable.
